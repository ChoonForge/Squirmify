      "The TCP three-way handshake establishes a connection through SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets. This process ensures both parties agree on initial sequence numbers and are ready to exchange data.

Most modern systems choose AP or CP configurations based on use case requirements. Eventual consistency models provide weaker guarantees but better performance.",

One-hot encoding transforms categorical variables into binary vectors. Cross-validation splits data into training and test sets to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization.",
      "Cryptographic hash functions are one-way transformations that produce fixed-size outputs from arbitrary inputs. SHA-256 generates 256-bit hashes used extensively in blockchain and digital signatures. Collision resistance ensures different inputs produce different outputs. Preimage resistance prevents reverse engineering the original input."
