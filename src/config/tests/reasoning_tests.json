      "prompt": "A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 die. How many sheep are left? Think through this step by step and explain your reasoning clearly.",
      "correctAnswer": "9 sheep (because 'all but 9' means 9 survived)"

      "prompt": "If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? Explain your reasoning step by step.",
      "correctAnswer": "5 minutes (each machine makes 1 widget in 5 minutes, so 100 machines make 100 widgets in 5 minutes)"
